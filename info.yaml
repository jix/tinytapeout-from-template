  title:        "7 segment seconds counter"
  description:  "counts up to 10, incrementing by 1 every second. The output is shown on the 7 segment display"
  how_it_works: "uses a chain of flip flops to count, with combinational logic to reset at 10. 
                    I used Karnaugh maps to work out the logic for BCD to 7 segment"
  how_to_test:  "Set the clock divider to get a 2Hz clock. Toggle input 2 to reset, the 7 segment should start counting"
  external_hw:  "none"
